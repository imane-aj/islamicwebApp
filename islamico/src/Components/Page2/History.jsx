        <p>Prophet Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in Arabia in 570 CE. He was an orphan at a young age and was raised by his grandfather and then by his uncle. As a young man, he worked as a merchant and gained a reputation for his honesty and fairness.

At the age of 40, Muhammad received his first revelation from God through the Angel Gabriel while meditating in a cave on Mount Hira outside Mecca. These revelations continued for the next 23 years, and were later compiled into the Islamic holy book, the Quran.

Muhammad began to preach the message of Islam to the people of Mecca, but was met with resistance from the city's powerful tribes. He eventually fled to the city of Medina, in what is known as the Hijra, in 622 CE. This event is considered the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

In Medina, Muhammad established the first Islamic state, and became the political and religious leader of the community. He continued to preach and spread the message of Islam, and the new community grew in strength.

After several years of conflict, Muhammad returned to Mecca in 630 CE at the head of a large army of Muslims. He entered the city peacefully, and many of the Meccans converted to Islam.

Muhammad continued to lead the Islamic community until his death in 632 CE. He is considered the last prophet of Islam, and his teachings and actions are recorded in the Hadith, a collection of his sayings and actions. Muhammad's legacy has had a profound impact on the world, and Islam has become one of the major religions in the world today.

The Quran is the central religious text of Islam, and contains the words of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It is the primary source of Islamic law and ethics, and is considered the final revelation from God to humanity. Some verses from the Quran that are commonly referenced in Islamic discourse include:

"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger" (Quran 48:29)
"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear" (Quran 2:286)
"O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan" (Quran 2:208)
The Hadith, on the other hand, is a collection of sayings, actions, and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, compiled by his companions and later scholars. It serves as a secondary source of Islamic law and ethics, and is used to provide context and interpretation to the Quran. Some Hadiths that are commonly referenced in Islamic discourse include:

"The best of you are those who are best to their families" (Bukhari)
"None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself" (Bukhari)
"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent" (Muslim)
Both the Quran and Hadith are considered essential sources of guidance for Muslims, and are studied and referenced extensively in Islamic scholarship and discourse.
