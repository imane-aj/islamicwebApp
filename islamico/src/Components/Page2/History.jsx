        <p>Prophet Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in Arabia in 570 CE. He was an orphan at a young age and was raised by his grandfather and then by his uncle. As a young man, he worked as a merchant and gained a reputation for his honesty and fairness.

At the age of 40, Muhammad received his first revelation from God through the Angel Gabriel while meditating in a cave on Mount Hira outside Mecca. These revelations continued for the next 23 years, and were later compiled into the Islamic holy book, the Quran.

Muhammad began to preach the message of Islam to the people of Mecca, but was met with resistance from the city's powerful tribes. He eventually fled to the city of Medina, in what is known as the Hijra, in 622 CE. This event is considered the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

In Medina, Muhammad established the first Islamic state, and became the political and religious leader of the community. He continued to preach and spread the message of Islam, and the new community grew in strength.

After several years of conflict, Muhammad returned to Mecca in 630 CE at the head of a large army of Muslims. He entered the city peacefully, and many of the Meccans converted to Islam.

Muhammad continued to lead the Islamic community until his death in 632 CE. He is considered the last prophet of Islam, and his teachings and actions are recorded in the Hadith, a collection of his sayings and actions. Muhammad's legacy has had a profound impact on the world, and Islam has become one of the major religions in the world today.
