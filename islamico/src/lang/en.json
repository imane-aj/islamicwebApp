Muhammad began receiving revelations from God through the Angel Gabriel when he was 40 years old, and these revelations were later compiled into the Islamic holy book, the Quran. Muhammad preached the message of Islam to the people of Mecca, but was met with resistance from the powerful tribes of the city. He eventually fled to Medina, a city to the north, in what is known as the Hijra, and established the first Islamic state. This event is considered the beginning of the Islamic calendar."

Within a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, Islamic armies had conquered much of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. Islamic civilization flourished during this time,  with the development of great cities like Baghdad and Cairo, and the establishment of universities  and centers of learning."
