Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him, preached the message of Islam to the people of Mecca, but was met with resistance from the powerful tribes of the city. He eventually fled to Medina, a city to the north, in what is known as the Hijra, and established the first Islamic state. This event is considered the beginning of the Islamic calendar."
